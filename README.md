Camply is a college-focused platform that simplifies how students discover and participate in opportunities within their campus. Events, hackathons, competitions, and club activities are often scattered across platforms, causing students to miss deadlines and struggle to connect with the right people.

Camply brings everything happening inside a college into one structured system. Powered by AI, it understands a student’s skills, interests, and past participation to suggest relevant opportunities instead of generic listings. Students can explore events, connect with peers from their campus, form teams, and track real participation.

Camply also includes Alpha AI, a 24/7 campus assistant that students can ask anything from finding opportunities to improving profiles or building teams. Alpha AI supports a Gen Z mode and prompt enhancement for better, more natural interactions. With verified points, campus leaderboards, and anonymous reviews, Camply creates a fair, transparent, and merit-based college ecosystem.
